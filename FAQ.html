        Streaming services have become increasingly popular over the past few years, especially since Covid kept all of us at home. 
        With this growing popularity some streaming services have started producing their own programing such as The Other Zoe is an 
        Amazon production or Lessons in Chemistry is an Apple studios production. Whichever system you choose there will always be options 
        everywhere to watch something. My primary viewing is with Amazon Prime as well as Disney+. The top 5 streaming services in Canada 
        are Netflix, Crave TV, Prime Video, Starz, and Paramount+, these all significantly differ in pricing as well as additional purchase 
        options for some with needing to pay to go ad free. Some also differ geographically, what is available in Canada might not be in 
        Mexico, or there might be some available in the USA but not in Canada.
